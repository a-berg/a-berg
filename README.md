My name is Adrian and I am a ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸ Spanish engineer currently employed at [Keepler](https://keepler.io/), where I specialize in machine learning for industrial processes, doing:

* ğŸ“Š Prescriptive systems
* ğŸ¤– AI
* ğŸ”§ MLOps

In my free time, apart from typical leisures (spending time with friends, family, or doing sports) I like to learn about new tools and languages, 
and deepen my understanding of computing.

Cheers!
