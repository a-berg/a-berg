### Hello, world

I'm Adrian, and I am an engineer from Spain ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸.
I currently work at [CiTiUS](https://citius.usc.es/) in machine learning for applications in industrial processes. 

Always enjoy a good problem. Trying to learn as much computer science and math as my brain is capable of ðŸ§ .
