My name is Adrian and I am a ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Spanish engineer currently employed at [Gradiant](https://gradiant.org/), where I specialize in machine learning for industrial processes, doing:

* ðŸ“Š Prescriptive systems
* ðŸ¤– AI
* ðŸ”§ MLOps

In my free time, apart from typical leisures (spending time with friends, family, or doing sports) I like to learn about new tools and languages, 
and deepen my understanding of computing. As such, I have done some MOOCs/self-learning on:

* [Bayesian Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/QEN52ACA8BBE)
* [MLOps with Tensorflow](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/QL6R7TW9DMT3)
* Learning Haskell
* Reading through the fantastic SICP (have to continue it, though!)
* Other libraries or tools (look pinned repos)

Cheers!
